As a young engineer working primarily with clients in the manufacturing sector, Yousif recognized the potential of computer-aided design (CAD) technology at a time when the industry still relied on paper drawings as its standard. He saw a widely untapped opportunity to improve quality and efficiency in project delivery and decided to build his own company from the ground up.
